<h1>Privacy Policy for Meta App</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date: August 19, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Meta App ("App"), developed and operated by Tall Box Consulting (Pty) Ltd, collects, uses, shares, and protects information in connection with our services. The App is designed to assist in scheduling and managing posts for the Wildlife Instagram page, which focuses on sharing content about wildlife, nature, and safari adventures (e.g., giraffe facts, animal photography, and user engagement prompts).</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and complying with applicable laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection regulations. This App integrates with Meta's Instagram Graph API to enable scheduling features for the page administrator. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this policy.</p>

<p>If you are the administrator of the Wildlife Instagram page, this policy applies to any data processed through the App. The App does not collect data from end-users of the Instagram page unless explicitly stated.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect the following types of information to provide our services:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Authentication details, such as access tokens or credentials from your Meta/Instagram account, to connect the App to your Wildlife Instagram page.</li>
            <li>Content-related data, such as post captions, hashtags, images, or scheduling dates, that you upload or input for posting to the page.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Information Collected Automatically:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Technical data, including IP address, browser type, device information, and usage logs (e.g., when you schedule a post).</li>
            <li>Data obtained via Meta's APIs, such as your Instagram Business Account ID, to facilitate posting.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Data received from Meta (e.g., via Graph API permissions), limited to what is necessary for scheduling posts, such as page management details.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>We do not collect sensitive personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, health data) unless it is voluntarily provided in post content, in which case it is treated as standard content data.</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

<p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To authenticate your access and connect the App to your Instagram page.</li>
    <li>To schedule, publish, and manage posts on the Wildlife Instagram page (e.g., automating uploads of wildlife photos and captions).</li>
    <li>To improve the App's functionality, troubleshoot issues, and analyze usage patterns.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations, such as responding to regulatory requests.</li>
    <li>For security purposes, such as detecting unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our legal basis for processing this data under GDPR (if applicable) includes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your consent (e.g., when granting API permissions).</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests (e.g., providing the scheduling service you requested).</li>
    <li>Contractual necessity (e.g., fulfilling the App's core functions).</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not use your data for personalized advertising unless you opt-in, and you can opt-out at any time by contacting us.</p>

<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>

<p>We may share your information in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>With Meta Platforms, Inc., as required for API integration (e.g., sharing access tokens to post content). This is governed by Meta's data use policies.</li>
    <li>With service providers (e.g., hosting or analytics tools) who assist in operating the App, under strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
    <li>If required by law, such as in response to a court order or government request.</li>
    <li>In the event of a business transfer (e.g., merger), but only with notice to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties. Any sharing with Meta or others is limited to what is necessary for the App's functionality.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure. This includes encryption for data in transit, access controls, and regular security reviews. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain your information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by law. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Authentication data is retained while your account is active.</li>
    <li>Post content data is deleted after successful scheduling or upon your request.</li>
    <li>Logs are retained for up to 12 months for security and debugging.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this period, data is securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Update inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your data (e.g., revoke API access and remove all stored information). To request deletion, email us at rael@tallbox.net. We will respond within 30 days.</li>
    <li><strong>Objection/Restriction:</strong> Object to processing or request restrictions in certain cases.</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Receive your data in a structured format.</li>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The App is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in some jurisdictions), and we do not knowingly collect data from them.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
